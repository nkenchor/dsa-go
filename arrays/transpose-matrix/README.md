Transpose Matrix • §
You're given a 2D array of integers matrix . Write a function that returns the transpose of the matrix.
The transpose of a matrix is a flipped version of the original matrix across its main diagonal (which runs from top-left to bottom-right); it switches the row and column indices of the original matrix.
You can assume the input matrix always has at least 1 value; however its width and height are not necessarily the same.
Sample Input #1
matrix = [
[1, 21,]
]
Sample Output # 1
[
[11,
[2]
]
]
Sample Input #2
matrix = [
[1, 21,
13, 41,
[5, 6]
]
]

Sample Output #2
[
[1, 3, 51,
[2, 4, 6]
]
